This is a simple game in which user have to guess the number which is randomly picked by computer using "random class".
In this program for taking computer number random class is used and for taking user input userInput() method is used using Scanner Class.
It also counts total number of attempts the user perfomed till the right guess, for this getter/setter is used with the variable total_attempt.
After that a boolean loop is used with nested if-else conditions for verifying whether the user input is smaller/greater or it's match.
If the user guess the number less than the actual number then it shows "too lower....Try again".
IF the user guess the number greater than the actual number then it shows "too higher....Try again".
The process repeates till the user meets to the actual number and it also counts the number of iterations ie. no. of attempts concurrently.
When the user guessed it right then it shows "You have guessed it right 10(for eg) is the number". and also shows number of attempts.
